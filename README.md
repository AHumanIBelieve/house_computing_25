# Space Issues
## By Mulcaster House
### Created for House Computing 2025

Your spaceship has been stranded. Your crewmates are dead. Oxygen is running out.
Hurry, astronaut.

## Game Objectives
The player must obtain the keycard from the `Storeroom`, before using it to open the safe in the `Captain's Quarters`. 
With the key obtained from the safe, the player must unlock the escape pods from the `Commmand centre`, before moving to the escape pods and leaving the craft.
The player has 35 turns to do so.
The ship's systems may break at random points during the game. If not repaired, they can damage the player, and after seven turns, blow up the ship.

## Gameplay
The game has three main commands:
* `move [up/down/left/right]` to move around the map
* `get [object]` to obtain an object
* `map` to view a map of the spacecraft.
